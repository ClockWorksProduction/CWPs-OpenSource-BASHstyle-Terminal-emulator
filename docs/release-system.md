# Release & Publishing System

This project uses a four-tier automated release system powered by GitHub Actions. The version number in `package.json` on the `main` branch serves as the single source of truth for the upcoming Stable release.

All pre-release channels (Dev, Bi-Weekly, LTS) are derived from this base version at build time and do not create commits in the repository.

## Release Channels

| Channel | npm Tag | Source Branch | Trigger | Version Format | Current Version |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | `@dev` | `main` | Every push | `{base-version}-dev.{git-sha}` | ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@clockworksproduction-studio/cwp-open-terminal-emulator/dev.svg) |
| **Bi-Weekly** | `@nightly`| `main` | Bi-weekly | `{base-version}-bwk.{yyyymmdd}` | ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@clockworksproduction-studio/cwp-open-terminal-emulator/nightly.svg) |
| **Stable** | `@latest` | `main` | Manual | `{base-version}` | ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@clockworksproduction-studio/cwp-open-terminal-emulator/latest.svg) |
| **LTS** | `@lts` | `release/vX`| Manual | `{base-version}-lts.{yyyymm}` | ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@clockworksproduction-studio/cwp-open-terminal-emulator/lts.svg) |
