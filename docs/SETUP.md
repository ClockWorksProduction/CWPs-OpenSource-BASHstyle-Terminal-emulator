# Setup Guide: CWP Open Terminal Emulator

This guide covers the different ways to install and configure the CWP Open Terminal Emulator in your web project.

## Automated Setup (Recommended)

For the fastest and easiest setup, use the automated CLI tool. This interactive script can generate a complete, ready-to-run project or integrate the terminal into your existing files.

Simply run the following command in your terminal and follow the prompts:

```bash
npx @clockworksproduction-studio/cwp-terminal-setup
```

The script offers three modes:

1.  **`scaffold`**: Creates a new `terminal-demo` directory with all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This is the best option for new users or for creating a clean test environment.
2.  **`refactor`**: Injects the terminal into your existing project by asking for the paths to your HTML, CSS, and JS files.
3.  **`manual`**: Generates a JavaScript snippet with custom DOM selectors, giving you full control over where the terminal components are rendered.

After the script finishes, your terminal will be ready to go.
